# Chicago-Food-Inspections

The City of Chicago has over 15,000 food establishments that undergo sanitation inspections by the Department of Public Health. These inspections are crucial for identifying critical violations related to food safety. However, the government entity is prone to resource limitations such as a limited number of inspectors.

For this project, we will act as a consulting firm to identify vulnerable businesses and aid them to form solutions using the data available to us. Our findings will help the concerned establishments allocate monetary resources to preemptive food inspection solutions before failing a real time food inspection, as well as identify points of failure suggested by the data we assess.

Some of our proposed analyses include:

- ETL → Extract, transform, and load data appropriately using data engineering procedures.
- Exploratory Data Analysis → Identifying points of concern based on data related to the location, demographics, inspection reports, and additional information.
- Data Visualizations → Mapping points of concern for further exploration of data through informative diagrams.

In conclusion, our project aims to uncover the reasons for food inspection failures in local businesses and act as a tool for businesses to collaborate with the City of Chicago and our consulting firm, addressing common concerns and allocating resources effectively.
